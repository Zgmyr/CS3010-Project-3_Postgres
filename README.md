# CS3010-Project-3_Postgres
This repository showcases the third and final project I built for CS3010 (Full Stack Web Development) with the University of Missouri-St Louis, which exposed me to working with HTML, CSS, React, Node.js, and Postgres. Each of the three projects here build upon the previous one, beginning with HTML/CSS in Project 1, React/Node.js in Project 2, and Postgres in Project 3.
